      "description": "The early 20th century was characterized by revolutionary artistic movements that broke decisively from representational art and explored new dimensions of reality, emotion, and the unconscious. Cubism (c. 1905–1939, core 1907–1914), invented by Pablo Picasso and Georges Braque, rejected traditional aesthetics, breaking down objects into geometric shapes to depict multiple perspectives simultaneously. Expressionism (c. 1890–1939, core 1905–1930) originated primarily in Germany, characterized by vibrant, emotionally charged colors and energetic brushstrokes, seeking to represent inner emotions. Surrealism (c. 1924–1945, core 1920s–1950s), founded by André Breton in 1924, was a cultural and philosophical revolution heavily influenced by Sigmund Freud's psychoanalytic theories, seeking to explore the unconscious mind, dreams, and the irrational. Breton's *Manifesto of Surrealism* (1924) defined Surrealism as 'pure psychic automatism.'",

      "description": "The mid-20th century saw American art gain international prominence and a continued radical redefinition of artistic practice and theory. Abstract Expressionism (c. 1945–1960) emerged in the United States, with artists like Jackson Pollock focusing on expressing emotions and the subconscious through abstract forms. Harold Rosenberg (1906–1978) coined the term 'action painting' in his 1952 essay 'The American Action Painters,' viewing the canvas as 'an arena in which to act.' Clement Greenberg (1909–1994), another influential critic, advocated a formalist aesthetic in his essay 'Modernist Painting' (1961), arguing that painting should be self-critical, focusing on flatness and color. Pop Art (c. 1956–1969) emerged as a reaction, reintroducing recognizable subject matter from popular culture, with Richard Hamilton famously listing its characteristics in 1957. Minimalism (c. 1960–1975) developed with a focus on simplicity and geometric forms, with Donald Judd (1928–1994) articulating its theory in 'Specific Objects' (1964). Conceptual Art (c. 1960s onwards) emphasized ideas over visual forms, with Sol LeWitt (1928–2007) stating in his 1967 essay 'Paragraphs on Conceptual Art' that 'the idea itself... is as much of a work of art as any finished product.'",

      "description": "The late 20th century saw the rise of Postmodernism, a broad intellectual and cultural movement that profoundly impacted art theory by questioning universal truths, grand narratives, and established systems of knowledge and power. Jean-François Lyotard (1924–1998), in *The Postmodern Condition: A Report on Knowledge* (1979), analyzed the commodification of knowledge and diagnosed a 'crisis of knowledge,' arguing that grand narratives were being dismantled. Jacques Derrida (1930–2004), through his theory of deconstruction (emerging in the 1970s), asserted that there is no single intrinsic meaning in a work, but rather multiple, often conflicting interpretations. Michel Foucault (1926–1984) introduced the concept of 'power-knowledge,' arguing that power is intricately linked to knowledge, shaping and reproducing it in accordance with its intentions.",

      "description": "Contemporary art theory is deeply engaged with issues of identity, globalization, and technological advancements, leading to new forms of artistic expression and critical frameworks. Identity Politics became a central theme, addressing issues of personal and cultural identity, race, gender, and social inequality. Feminist art theory, exemplified by Linda Nochlin's influential 1971 essay 'Why Have There Been No Great Women Artists?' and Griselda Pollock's *Vision and Difference* (1988), challenged the male-centric art historical canon. Postcolonial theory, with Edward Said's *Orientalism* (1978) and Homi Bhabha's *The Location of Culture* (1994), explored themes of resistance and challenged Eurocentric knowledge systems. Relational Aesthetics (emerging in the 1990s), defined by Nicolas Bourriaud in his 1998 book *Esthétique relationnelle*, takes 'the whole of human relations and their social context' as its point of departure. Digital Art and New Media Art represent a significant development, reflecting the impact of technology on art creation, dissemination, and criticism.",
