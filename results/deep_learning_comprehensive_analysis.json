This era saw significant contributions such as 'Neural Networks: A Comprehensive Foundation' (1998) and 'Neural Networks for Pattern Recognition' (1995), which provided a thorough mathematical understanding of the field, building upon earlier foundational work like 'Understanding Face Recognition'. Additionally, papers addressing cognitive science aspects and recurrent neural networks, such as 'Bidirectional Recurrent Neural Networks' (1997), highlighted the growing interest in modeling complex data analysis processes. Research on face recognition systems was further examined in 'Human and machine recognition of faces: a survey' (1995), demonstrating how deep learning techniques were being applied to real-world problems like visual attention, thereby solidifying its role as a crucial method for analyzing and interpreting complex sensory information.",
