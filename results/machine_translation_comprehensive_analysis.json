This approach, exemplified by the syntactic analysis survey (1899) and the exploration of phrase structure grammars in 'Three models for the description of language' (1956), sought to represent language as a system of rules that could be computationally manipulated. The interlingual machine translation concept (1958) further solidified this paradigm by advocating for a logically formalized interlingua, demonstrating a commitment to rule-based systems for bridging linguistic differences.",

The development of spatial filters for code translation ('A Computer Generated Spatial Filter, Applied to Code Translation') and the estimation of translation parameters ('Estimation of the Larger Translation Parameter') further demonstrate a focus on formalizing translation processes through mathematical and computational methods, aligning with the paradigm's emphasis on rule-based systems.",

This approach, evident in 'Contextual Word Recognition Using Binary Digrams' (focus on parsing and syntax) and 'Computational Understanding: Analysis of Sentences and Context' (prioritizing meaning extraction through linguistic models), sought to encode linguistic knowledge into computational systems, reflecting a belief that translation could be achieved through explicit grammatical transformations. The focus on theoretical foundations, as highlighted in 'The Theory of Parsing, Translation, and Compiling,' underscored the importance of rigorous linguistic analysis as the cornerstone of machine translation.",

The emphasis on symbolic representation and algorithmic processing, as seen in 'Design of Sequential Machines from Their Regular Expressions' (1961), reflected a belief that translation could be automated through the application of predefined rules, contrasting with the more nuanced, context-dependent understanding of translation explored in 'Toward a Science of Translating' (1964).",
