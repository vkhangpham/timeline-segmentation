The papers on fluid dynamics (Bell), gas dynamics (dynamical theory of gases), and capillary flow demonstrate the application of this approach to physical systems, while the axiomatic geometry work (system of axioms for geometry) reflects a broader movement towards formalization and precision, ultimately shaping the field's direction towards more sophisticated modeling and analytical techniques.",

This involved a heightened emphasis on formal mathematical justification alongside the development of functional analysis techniques to model and solve complex physical problems, as seen in Borel's work on real variable functions and Lindel\u00f6f's calculus of residues. The papers on fluid dynamics (Bell), gas dynamics (dynamical theory of gases), and capillary flow demonstrate the application of this approach to physical systems, while the axiomatic geometry work (system of axioms for geometry) reflects a broader movement towards formalization and precision, ultimately shaping the field's direction towards more sophisticated modeling and analytical techniques."

(interpolation theory), Sur des \u00e9quations diff\u00e9rentielles (third-order equations), and \u00dcber eine Klasse von Differentialsystemen (arbitrary order systems), which focus on properties and solutions of these systems. The emphasis on analytic functions, as seen in The Mean Value of the Modulus and Recherches sur les transcendantes de M. Painlev\u00e9, reflects a broader trend towards rigorous mathematical analysis underpinning applied problems, while Einige Ungleichungen F\u00fcr Zweimal Differentiierbare Funktionen demonstrates the application of these analytic tools to practical engineering problems."

While the calculi of lambda-conversion (1941) explored abstract computational frameworks, the core emphasis remained on finding analytical expressions, demonstrating a preference for deterministic, closed-form results over iterative or numerical methods."
