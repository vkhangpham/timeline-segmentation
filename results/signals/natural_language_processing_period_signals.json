This involved leveraging increasingly large datasets to train deep learning models, particularly those based on neural networks. A core element was the development of distributed representations of words and phrases (e.g., Word2Vec, GloVe, BERT), enabling models to capture semantic relationships. Crucially, the field embraced transfer learning, utilizing pre-trained models (like BERT) and fine-tuning them for specific downstream tasks. The emphasis moved from hand-engineered features and rule-based systems to automatically learning representations from data, with a strong focus on contextualized word embeddings and leveraging pre-trained models for improved performance across a wide range of NLP tasks.  The papers demonstrate this progression: \u2018Word Representations: A Simple and General Method for Semi-Supervised Learning\u2019 (2010) established the importance of unsupervised word embeddings, while \u2018BERT: Pre-training of Deep Bidirectional Transformers for Language Understanding\u2019 (2018) exemplifies the paradigm\u2019s culmination with large-scale pre-training and transfer learning.",

This involved leveraging increasingly large datasets to train deep learning models, particularly those based on neural networks. A core element was the development of distributed representations of words and phrases (e.g., Word2Vec, GloVe, BERT), enabling models to capture semantic relationships. Crucially, the field embraced transfer learning, utilizing pre-trained models (like BERT) and fine-tuning them for specific downstream tasks. The emphasis moved from hand-engineered features and rule-based systems to automatically learning representations from data, with a strong focus on contextualized word embeddings and leveraging pre-trained models for improved performance across a wide range of NLP tasks.  The papers demonstrate this progression: \u2018Word Representations: A Simple and General Method for Semi-Supervised Learning\u2019 (2010) established the importance of unsupervised word embeddings, while \u2018BERT: Pre-training of Deep Bidirectional Transformers for Language Understanding\u2019 (2018) exemplifies the paradigm\u2019s culmination with large-scale pre-training and transfer learning."
