This approach, exemplified by 'Neural networks for pattern recognition' (1994) and 'Multivariate Data Analysis' (1997), focused on formulating machine learning problems as statistical inference tasks, utilizing techniques like regression, clustering, and principal component analysis. The focus was on rigorous statistical evaluation and optimization, as seen in the application of Marquardt algorithm for neural network training ('Training feedforward networks with the Marquardt algorithm', 1994) and the development of Fisherface for improved facial recognition ('Eigenfaces vs. Fisherfaces', 1997), demonstrating a shift towards data-driven models grounded in statistical principles.",
