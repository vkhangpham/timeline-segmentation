Scott explores the complex dynamics between the powerful and the powerless, highlighting how subordinate groups use hidden transcripts\u2014such as gossip, folktales, and humor\u2014to critique authority and assert their agency. Through historical and cultural examples, Scott reveals the subtle forms of resistance that challenge dominant narratives and the ways in which ruling elites maintain their hegemony.\n\nTopic: art education, contemporary china, coercion, social force, anti-imperialism, critical theory, protest, performance studies, resistance management, art, class conflict, postcolonial writing, feminist theory, specific resistance, art history, contemporary art, performance art, conflict",
