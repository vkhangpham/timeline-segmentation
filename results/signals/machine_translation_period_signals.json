Research focused on parameter estimation (e.g., 'The mathematics of statistical machine translation' in 1993) and incorporating language models to improve fluency. The development of a unified architecture for natural language processing ('A unified architecture for natural language processing', 2008) shows an increasing integration with broader NLP tasks, while the use of n-gram co-occurrence statistics ('Automatic evaluation of machine translation quality using n-gram co-occ\noccurrence statistics') and maximum entropy models (from 'Discriminative training and maximum entropy models for statistical machine translation', 2001) indicate a trend towards more sophisticated discriminative methods. This period saw the maturation and refinement of statistical techniques, with contributions from applied mathematics and computational linguistics.",
