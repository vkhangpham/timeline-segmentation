The influence of psychology, as seen in Arnheim\u2019s \u2018Art and Visual Perception,\u2019 further shaped the approach, prioritizing the study of how the human mind perceives and interprets visual information.

Researchers utilized psychological and anthropological frameworks to understand artistic creation and reception, focusing on the symbolic meaning embedded within artistic forms and the cognitive processes involved in their interpretation. This approach, exemplified by works like 'The Image of the City' and 'Art and Illusion,' prioritized understanding the relationship between artistic representation, human perception, and cultural context, establishing a foundation for later semiotic and cognitive art theory.",

The representative papers \u2013 including those examining mixed reality displays, image layering, photo novella, and the representation of moving images \u2013 consistently employed methodologies focused on mapping cognitive processes (perception, memory, understanding) onto artistic forms and systems.  Specifically, 'Images of Mind' and the layered image analysis demonstrated a commitment to quantifying and modeling the cognitive mechanisms underlying artistic experience, aligning with the broader trend of applying cognitive science principles to the study of art, as evidenced by the systematic mapping of visual and verbal representations, as seen in 'Picture Theory' and the detailed analysis of image systems within mixed reality displays.",

As evidenced by papers like \u2018Image inpainting\u2019 and \u2018What is beautiful is usable,\u2019 researchers focused on quantifying aesthetic judgments, modeling perceptual processes, and utilizing computational tools to analyze artistic form and its impact on human cognition. The \u2018Digital Michelangelo Project\u2019 and \u2018The Skin of the Film\u2019 further illustrate this trend, demonstrating the application of digital technologies to both the creation and interpretation of art, reflecting a shift towards a scientifically informed, data-driven approach within the field of art research.",

This approach, exemplified by the focus on improving texture recognition and generating photo-realistic images, established a foundation for the increasing integration of data science and machine learning within the field of Art, moving beyond purely humanistic interpretations towards a more objective and measurable understanding of artistic form and value.",

The representative papers demonstrate a shared reliance on hybrid systems combining algorithmic processing with human-defined parameters and datasets, reflecting a move towards a more objective and quantifiable understanding of artistic creation and value.",

Representative works like Arnheim\u2019s \u2018Art and Visual Perception,\u2019 the \u2018Representation and Matching of Pictorial Structures\u2019 article, and the application of ART techniques demonstrate a shift from purely subjective interpretations to a systematic, quantifiable investigation of visual form, aligning with a broader trend in cognitive science and emphasizing the underlying structural principles governing perception and representation.",

The representative papers \u2013 including those examining mixed reality displays, image layering, photo novella, and the representation of moving images \u2013 consistently employed methodologies focused on mapping cognitive processes (perception, memory, understanding) onto artistic forms and systems.  Specifically, 'Images of Mind' and the layered image analysis demonstrated a commitment to quantifying and modeling the cognitive mechanisms underlying artistic experience, aligning with the broader trend of applying cognitive science principles to the study of art, as evidenced by the systematic mapping of visual and verbal representations, as seen in 'Picture Theory' and the detailed analysis of image systems within mixed reality displays.",

The representative papers demonstrate a shift from primarily interpretive or symbolic approaches to one that prioritized quantifiable data \u2013 particularly in object recognition (describing objects by their attributes, photo tourism) \u2013 alongside the recognition of complex, hybrid systems (remix, hybrid economy). This involved applying computational methods (feature selection, 3D interfaces) to understand artistic production and consumption, alongside acknowledging the interconnectedness of art, technology, and economic forces. The focus on \u2018systems\u2019 \u2013 encompassing technological, economic, and social \u2013 reflects a move towards a more holistic, and ultimately, measurable approach to studying art, a trend foreshadowing later developments in computational art and digital humanities.",
