Furthermore, the use of rich feature hierarchies was refined for applications such as semantic segmentation and accurate object detection, with contributions highlighted in 'Rich Feature Hierarchies for Accurate Object Detection and Semantic Segmentation' (2014).

Furthermore, the use of rich feature hierarchies was refined for applications such as semantic segmentation and accurate object detection, with contributions highlighted in 'Rich Feature Hierarchies for Accurate Object Detection and Semantic Segmentation' (2014).

It highlights the network's architecture, including its use of dropout for regularization and efficient GPU implementation, which contributed to its success in the ILSVRC-2012 competition.\n\nTopic: computer science, data classification, machine learning, intelligent classification, automatic classification, image analysis, convolutional neural network, biomedical imaging, data science, image representation, computational imaging, deep learning, machine learning research, digital image processing, medical image computing, imagenet classification, health science, neural network (machine learning), image classification",
