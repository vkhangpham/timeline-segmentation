# Ablation Study (Phase 10): Two-Signal Timeline Segmentation Algorithm

**A Comprehensive Evaluation of the Simplified Citation + Direction Architecture Following Algorithm Reconstruction**

---

## Abstract

**Background**: Following Phase 8-9 findings that demonstrated direction signal dominance (Œº=13.3) over semantic signals (Œº=2.4) and universal subadditive behavior (25.1% signal reduction), Phase 10 implemented fundamental algorithm reconstruction to focus on the two most effective mechanisms: citation disruption detection and research direction volatility analysis.

**Objective**: This ablation study evaluates the performance of the simplified two-signal architecture across five high-priority technical domains, measuring signal contribution patterns, computational efficiency gains, and preservation of paradigm detection capabilities.

**Methods**: We conducted 15 controlled experiments (3 conditions √ó 5 domains) testing Citation-Only, Direction-Only, and Citation + Direction (Fusion) configurations using real research data from 1950-2023.

**Results**: Direction signals maintain overwhelming dominance (9.4 vs 0.6 average paradigm shifts), universal subadditive behavior persists (100% of domains), and computational efficiency improved by 76% while preserving 45 paradigm shifts across technical domains.

**Conclusions**: The two-signal architecture successfully achieves dramatic simplification (semantic detection removal) while maintaining robust paradigm detection capabilities, confirming the effectiveness of the Phase 10 reconstruction strategy.

## 1. Introduction

The Phase 10 algorithm reconstruction represents a fundamental shift from the original three-signal architecture (Citation + Semantic + Direction) to a streamlined two-signal approach (Citation + Direction) based on comprehensive ablation evidence from Phase 8-9 studies.

### 1.1 Motivation for Simplification

Previous ablation studies revealed:
- **Direction signal dominance**: 13.3 vs 2.4 average paradigm shifts (semantic)

- **Computational overhead**: Semantic processing contributed ~70% of processing time

### 1.2 Research Questions

1. **Signal Hierarchy Preservation**: Does direction dominance persist in the simplified architecture?
2. **Computational Efficiency**: What performance gains result from semantic removal?
3. **Detection Capability**: Are paradigm detection capabilities preserved?
4. **Filtering Mechanisms**: Do subadditive behaviors continue with two signals?
