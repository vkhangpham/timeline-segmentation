# Phase 11: Citation Paradigm Shift Detection (CPSD) Implementation Plan

## Executive Summary

Based on comprehensive research and Phase 11 findings, PELT (Pruned Exact Linear Time) is fundamentally inadequate for citation time series analysis. Our comprehensive analysis revealed PELT performs 56x worse than gradient-based methods, detecting only 5 signals compared to 282 by gradient methods across 8 domains.

## Research Findings

### PELT Fundamental Inadequacy
- **Performance Gap**: PELT detected 5 total signals vs 282 by gradient methods (56.4x worse)
- **Domain Coverage**: Computer Vision and Machine Translation showed 0 PELT detections
- **Algorithmic Mismatch**: PELT designed for stationary financial data, not citation exponential growth
- **Missed Major Shifts**: Failed to detect deep learning revolution (2012), neural MT revolution, etc.

### Alternative Algorithm Performance
```
Algorithm Performance Comparison:
- PELT:              5 signals (0.6 avg/domain) - BASELINE
- Binary Segmentation: 33 signals (4.1 avg) - 6.6x better  
- Sliding Window:    158 signals (19.8 avg) - 31.6x better
- Z-Score:           74 signals (9.3 avg) - 14.8x better
- Percentile Regime: 56 signals (7.0 avg) - 11.2x better
- Gradient:          282 signals (35.3 avg) - 56.4x better
```

### Academic Literature Validation
Research confirms citation time series require specialized algorithms:
- **Wild Binary Segmentation**: Superior for multiple change-points in close proximity
- **Citation Burst Detection**: Academic literature shows burst patterns indicate paradigm shifts
- **Bibliometric Analysis**: Time series methods specifically designed for citation analysis

## Citation Paradigm Shift Detection (CPSD) Algorithm

### Architecture Overview
Multi-layer detection system specifically designed for citation time series:

1. **Layer 1: Citation Acceleration Detection (Primary)**
   - Multi-scale gradient analysis (1, 3, 5-year windows)
   - First derivative (acceleration/deceleration detection)
   - Second derivative (inflection point detection)
   - Adaptive thresholds based on domain characteristics

2. **Layer 2: Regime Change Detection (Secondary)**
   - Statistical variance and mean change detection
   - Log transformation for exponential growth handling
   - Sliding window analysis optimized for citation patterns

3. **Layer 3: Citation Burst Analysis (Validation)**
   - Sudden citation explosions (>2-3x increases)
   - Sustained growth pattern recognition
   - Citation acceleration burst detection

4. **Layer 4: Binary Segmentation (Baseline)**
   - Modified binary segmentation optimized for citation data
   - Hierarchical splitting with citation-aware scoring

5. **Layer 5: Ensemble Integration**
   - Weighted combination of all detection methods
   - Confidence scoring based on method agreement
   - Temporal clustering and validation

### Key Algorithmic Innovations

#### Multi-Scale Gradient Analysis
```python
# Citation acceleration detection
for window in [1, 3, 5]:
    gradient = np.gradient(smooth(citations, window))
    acceleration = np.gradient(gradient)
    
    # Adaptive thresholds
    grad_threshold = adaptive_threshold(gradient)
    accel_threshold = adaptive_threshold(acceleration)
```

#### Domain-Adaptive Thresholds
- Gradient threshold: `std(gradient) * 1.5`
- Acceleration threshold: `median_absolute_deviation(acceleration) * 2.0`
- Domain-specific confidence floors based on citation characteristics

#### Ensemble Weighting
```python
ensemble_weights = {
    'gradient': 0.4,      # Primary method (best performance)
    'regime': 0.3,        # Secondary validation
    'burst': 0.2,         # Citation-specific patterns
    'binary_seg': 0.1     # Baseline comparison
}
```
