# Phase 12: Comprehensive Ablation Study for Timeline Segmentation Algorithm

## Overview

Phase 12 implements a systematic ablation study to rigorously evaluate each component of our timeline segmentation algorithm. This experimental framework is designed to provide the empirical foundation for academic publication of our research.

## Research Questions

**RQ1: Signal Type Contribution Analysis**  
What is the individual and combined contribution of each signal type to paradigm detection accuracy?

**RQ2: Temporal Proximity Filtering Effectiveness**  
How does temporal clustering affect segmentation quality and user control over timeline resolution?

**RQ3: Granularity Control Validation**  
Does our granularity control system enable reliable user control over timeline resolution?

**RQ4: CPSD Algorithm Component Analysis**  
Which components of the 5-layer CPSD architecture contribute most to citation-based paradigm detection?

**RQ5: Statistical Significance Calibration**  
Does statistical calibration enhance segmentation accuracy across varying data quality conditions?

## Project Guidelines Compliance

- **Functional Programming**: All experiments use pure functions with immutable data structures
- **Real Data**: No mock data - all experiments use actual domain datasets
- **Fail Fast**: No error catching - problems surface immediately for investigation
- **Critical Evaluation**: High bar for accepting results with quantitative validation
- **Fundamental Solutions**: Address root causes rather than implementing workarounds
