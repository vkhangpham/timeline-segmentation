Ablation Studies Module for Timeline Segmentation Algorithm

This module implements comprehensive ablation studies to understand the contribution 
of individual algorithmic components and validate design choices in the timeline 
segmentation pipeline.

Experiments:
1. Signal Detection Modality Analysis
2. Temporal Window Sensitivity Analysis  
3. Keyword Filtering Impact Assessment
4. Citation Validation Strategy Comparison
5. Segmentation Boundary Methods

All experiments follow functional programming principles with pure functions
and fail-fast error handling.
