- 40-60th percentile → Low significance (0.4)
- Bottom 40% → Minimal significance (0.1)

**Benefits**:
- ✅ Domain-adaptive significance scoring
- ✅ No external data dependencies
- ✅ Reflects actual research impact within domain context

### 3.2. Network-based Period Characterization
**Enhanced Features**:
- **Network Stability**: Measures consistency of citation patterns within periods
- **Community Persistence**: Tracks research group formation and evolution
- **Flow Stability**: Analyzes citation flow patterns and disruptions
- **Centrality Consensus**: Evaluates agreement on important papers within periods
