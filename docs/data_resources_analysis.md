# Analysis of Data Resources for Period Signal Detection

## 1. Overview
This document provides an analysis of available data resources across seven domains. It outlines the structure, content, and key statistics of each dataset to inform the development of period signal detection algorithms.

## 2. Data Resource Summary
The data is organized into three main types of files for each domain.

### 2.1. Paper Documents (`docs_info.json`)
- **Coverage**: 213-473 papers per domain (total: 2,581 papers).
- **Content**: Contains paper metadata, including title, abstract, publication year, citation counts, keywords, citation links, and an AI-generated summary.
- **Key Fields**:
    - `title`: Paper title.
    - `content`: Abstract or content (average 791-1960 characters).
    - `pub_year`: Publication year (temporal coverage from 1992-2020+).
    - `cited_by_count`: Number of citations.
    - `keywords`: 8-20 domain-specific keywords per paper.
    - `children`: Links to cited papers.
    - `description`: AI-generated summary with topic analysis.
- **Potential Applications in Period Detection**:
    - The `pub_year` field can be used to analyze the temporal distribution of publications.
    - The `content` and `keywords` fields can be used for content similarity and thematic coherence analysis.
    - `cited_by_count` and `children` fields allow for analysis of citation patterns.

### 2.2. Breakthrough Papers (`breakthrough_papers.jsonl`)
- **Coverage**: 130-235 curated papers per domain (total: 1,345 papers), identified as high-impact.
- **Content**: Detailed metadata for selected high-impact papers.
- **Key Fields**:
    - `openalex_fwci`: Field-weighted citation impact.
    - `rank_in_year`: Temporal importance ranking.
    - `abstract_inverted_index`: Full abstract.
    - `venue`: Publication venue.
    - `openalex_topics`: Research topic classification.
- **Potential Applications in Period Detection**:
    - Identifying papers with high significance scores for weighting.
    - Using impact metrics as indicators of research consensus.
    - Tracking methodological milestones.

### 2.3. Citation Network Graph (`entity_relation_graph.graphml.xml`)
- **Coverage**: 147-2,355 citation relationships per domain (total: 6,883 relationships).
- **Content**: A graph structure where each citation link includes a semantic description of the relationship.
- **Key Fields**:
    - **Semantic descriptions**: All citation relationships have a corresponding natural language description (average 225-764 characters).
- **Sample Semantic Descriptions**:
    - *"The child paper, BERT, builds on the foundational concepts of word representation introduced in the parent paper, GloVe, by developing a more advanced language representation model..."*
    - *"The child paper builds on the parent paper by utilizing deep convolutional neural networks for image classification, achieving improved performance metrics..."*
- **Potential Applications in Period Detection**:
    - Analyzing semantic descriptions to identify patterns in how research builds upon prior work.
    - Tracking the evolution of techniques through their descriptions.
    - Using the similarity of descriptions as an indicator of period coherence.
