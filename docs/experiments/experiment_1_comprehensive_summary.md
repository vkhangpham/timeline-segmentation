Clear signal source hierarchy emerged:
1. **Direction signals**: Œº=13.3 ¬± 7.48 (Dominant backbone)
2. **Combined signals**: Œº=12.9 ¬± 6.73 (Optimally filtered)
3. **Semantic signals**: Œº=2.4 ¬± 1.77 (Consistent validation)
4. **Citation signals**: Œº=0.9 ¬± 0.64 (Selective confirmation)

### **Finding 3: Domain-Specific Signal Patterns**
**High-variance domains** (ML: œÉ=8.52, CS: œÉ=8.71, Art: œÉ=10.27):
- Direction signals dominate (19-21 signals)
- Strong subadditive effects (25-30% reduction)
- Algorithm demonstrates sophisticated domain adaptation

**Low-variance domains** (MT: œÉ=1.11, NLP: œÉ=2.71):
