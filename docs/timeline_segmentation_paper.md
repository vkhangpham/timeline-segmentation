### 2.1 Pipeline Overview
The proposed system maps raw bibliographic records to an interpretable chronology of paradigm shifts.  The pipeline consists of three computational stages followed by a learning layer:

1. **Shift Detection** A dual-modality detector locates candidate paradigm-shift years using both research-direction volatility and citation-gradient anomalies.
2. **Signal Fusion** Direction and citation evidence are combined through a transparent confidence model that enforces a configurable acceptance threshold.
3. **Segmentation** Validated shift years serve as centroids for a similarity-based boundary algorithm that yields non-overlapping, contiguous time segments.
4. **Parameter Optimisation** A Bayesian optimisation loop tunes key hyper-parameters against a consensus–difference quality objective.

Figure 1 illustrates this process using Natural Language Processing as an exemplar, showing how 14 paradigm shifts are detected and validated across 72 years of research evolution:

![Figure 1: NLP Paradigm Shifts and Keyword Evolution](figure1_nlp_signals.png)

### 2.2 Research-Direction Shift Detection  
*Keyword Novelty Model*

We treat each publication as a bag of annotated keywords.  For year \(t\) we define two non-overlapping sliding windows spanning 6 years total: a **previous window** \(W_p(t) = \{t-6,t-5,t-4\}\) and a **current window** \(W_c(t) = \{t-3,t-2,t-1\}\).  Let \(K_p\) and \(K_c\) denote the multisets of keywords in the previous and current windows, respectively.  Novelty and overlap are computed as
\[
\text{Novelty}(t) = \frac{|K_c \setminus K_p|}{|K_c|},\qquad
\text{Overlap}(t) = \frac{|K_c \cap K_p|}{|K_p|}.
\]
The **direction-change score** is
\[
S_{dir}(t) = \text{Novelty}(t) \cdot \bigl(1-\text{Overlap}(t)\bigr).
\]
A year is flagged if \(S_{dir}(t) > \tau_{dir}\), where \(\tau_{dir}\) is the *direction threshold*.

*Conservative Keyword Filtering* Before computing \(S_{dir}\), keywords with document frequency below \(p_{min}\times |W_c(t)|\) are discarded to mitigate noise while preserving recall (default \(p_{min}=0.05\)).

*Multi-Word Phrase Enrichment* Keywords are enriched with multi-word phrases extracted using YAKE (Yet Another Keyword Extractor) to capture semantic concepts that unigram keywords miss. Up to 10 top-ranked phrases per paper are appended to the keyword set, improving both consensus (C1) and difference (D1) metrics through richer vocabulary representation for temporal analysis.

### 2.3 Citation-Gradient Validation  
For each domain we aggregate yearly citation counts \(C_t\) and evaluate first- and second-order discrete derivatives over three temporal resolutions \(\{1,3,5\}\) years. This multi-scale approach captures different paradigm shift patterns: 1-year windows detect sudden breaks, 3-year windows identify gradual transitions, and 5-year windows reveal long-term evolutionary changes.

Given gradient series \(G_t = \nabla C_t\) and acceleration \(A_t = \nabla^2 C_t\), adaptive thresholds are computed as
\[
\theta_G = 1.5\,\sigma(G),\qquad \theta_A = 2\,\operatorname{MAD}(A),
\]
where \(\sigma\) is the standard deviation and MAD the median absolute deviation. The gradient threshold uses standard deviation (sensitive to outliers) to detect sharp citation changes, while the acceleration threshold uses MAD (robust to outliers) to identify structural inflection points. An index is deemed *citation-anomalous* if \(|G_t|>\theta_G\) or \(|A_t|>\theta_A\).  The **citation confidence** is normalised strength:
\[
\gamma_t = \min\Bigl(\frac{|G_t|}{\theta_G},2\Bigr)/2,\quad \gamma_t\in[0.3,0.95].
\]
Detected years are merged using a minimum spacing constraint \(\Delta_{min}=3\) to avoid cluster artefacts.

### 2.4 Direction–Citation Fusion and Confidence Model
For each direction candidate year \(y\) we query citation signals within a symmetric window \(\pm w_{cit}\).  The final confidence is
\[
\hat{c}_y = \begin{cases}
 c_y & \text{if no citation support},\\
 \min\bigl(c_y + \beta\,c_y, 1\bigr) & \text{if citation support present},
\end{cases}
\]
where \(c_y\) is the raw direction confidence \(S_{dir}(y)\), \(w_{cit}=3\) and boost factor \(\beta=0.8\). The multiplicative boost \(\beta \cdot c_y\) ensures that higher-confidence direction signals receive proportionally larger citation validation boosts, while the minimum operator prevents over-confidence. A year is accepted as a **validated shift** if \(\hat{c}_y \ge \tau_{val}\), the *validation threshold*.

Figure 2 demonstrates the citation validation mechanism and parameter optimization patterns across domains:

![Figure 2: Citation Validation Process and Parameter Optimization](figure2_citation_validation.png)

### 2.5 Contiguous Segment Construction
Validated shift years \(\{s_1<\dots<s_m\}\) partition the timeline.  For adjacent centroids \(s_i, s_{i+1}\) we scan intermediate years \(t\) to locate the first crossover where Jaccard keyword similarity favours \(s_{i+1}\) over \(s_i\). 

The boundary detection algorithm examines each year \(t \in (s_i, s_{i+1})\) and computes Jaccard similarities \(J(K_t, K_{s_i})\) and \(J(K_t, K_{s_{i+1}})\) where \(K_t\) represents the keyword set for year \(t\). The optimal boundary is the first year where \(J(K_t, K_{s_{i+1}}) > J(K_t, K_{s_i})\), indicating that the research focus has shifted closer to the later paradigm.

The resulting boundaries are post-processed to guarantee each segment length \(\ell\) satisfies
\[
\ell_{min} \le \ell \le \ell_{max},\qquad \ell_{min}=3,\; \ell_{max}=50.
\]
If feasibility is violated, neighbouring segments are greedily merged until all constraints hold. This merging process prioritizes segments with higher keyword similarity to preserve coherent research periods.

Figure 3 illustrates the segmentation process using Machine Learning as an exemplar:

![Figure 3: Machine Learning Segmentation Formation Process](figure3_segmentation_process.png)

### 2.6 Consensus–Difference Quality Metric
Let \(\mathcal{S}=\{\mathcal{P}_k\}_{k=1}^K\) be the set of segment paper clusters.  We quantify quality along two orthogonal axes:

*Within-segment consensus* (C-metrics)
  1. **C1** Mean Jaccard overlap between each paper's keywords and segment keyword set.
  2. **C2** Mean pairwise cosine similarity of TF-IDF embeddings of titles/abstracts.
  3. **C3** Citation-edge density within the segment.

*Between-segment difference* (D-metrics)
  1. **D1** Jensen–Shannon divergence of segment keyword distributions.
  2. **D2** Centroid distance: 1 – cosine similarity of TF-IDF centroids.
  3. **D3** Cross-citation ratio between consecutive segments.

Aggregate scores:
\[
Q_{cons} = 0.4\,C1+0.4\,C2+0.2\,C3, \qquad
Q_{diff} = 0.4\,D1+0.4\,D2+0.2(1-D3).
\]
The weighting scheme emphasizes textual coherence (C1, C2) and distinction (D1, D2) over citation patterns (C3, D3), reflecting that keyword and content analysis provide more reliable paradigm indicators than citation networks, which may be influenced by external factors such as publication delays and citation practices.

The final objective maximised during optimisation is
\[\mathcal{L}=0.1\,\overline{Q}_{cons}+0.9\,\overline{Q}_{diff}.\]

*Citation Enrichment and Vectorization Optimization* The system implements comprehensive citation enrichment by loading citation networks directly from JSON metadata and GraphML files, enabling meaningful C3 and D3 metrics. TF-IDF vectorization with 10,000 maximum features provides optimal performance balance, outperforming both smaller vocabularies and contextual embeddings for temporal segmentation tasks.

*Segment Count Penalty* An exponential penalty \(\exp(-|K-K_{desired}|/\sigma)\) is applied to discourage over-segmentation or under-segmentation, where \(K_{desired} = \text{round}(\text{domain\_year\_span}/10)\) provides domain-appropriate granularity expectations.

Figure 4 shows the Bayesian optimization process that enables domain-specific parameter tuning:

![Figure 4: Bayesian Parameter Optimization Analysis](figure5_optimization_process.png)

### 2.7 Bayesian Parameter Optimisation
We tune \(\Theta = (\tau_{dir}, \tau_{val}, \ell_{min}, \ell_{max})\) within bounds
\[\tau_{dir}\in[0.1,0.4],\; \tau_{val}\in[0.3,0.45],\; \ell_{min}\in[3,5],\; \ell_{max}\in[10,30].\]
A Gaussian-Process surrogate with Expected Improvement acquisition drives the search for up to 100 evaluations, using a domain-specific random seed.  Failed or infeasible evaluations receive a large negative reward, ensuring optimizer stability.

## 3 Experiments

### 3.1 Datasets
We evaluate on *eight* scholarly domains that exhibit diverse publication rates and citation cultures:

| Domain | Papers | Years | Avg. papers / year |
|--------|-------:|------:|-------------------:|
| Applied Mathematics | 465 | 1892–2021 | 4 |
| Art | 473 | 1835–2024 | 2 |
| Computer Science | 456 | 1936–2023 | 5 |

| Machine Translation | 225 | 1992–2021 | 8 |
| Natural Language Processing | 440 | 1951–2023 | 6 |

Each domain provides bibliographic metadata including title, abstract content, author keywords, publication year, citation count, and citation relationships. Ground-truth historical periods collected by domain experts are available for all domains and are used only for evaluation, **never** for training.

### 3.2 Baselines
We compare against three reference systems together with our **Bayesian-Optimised Algorithm**:

1. **Bayesian-Optimised Algorithm** Our pipeline with parameters tuned by the Gaussian-Process Bayesian optimiser described in § 2.7.
2. **Decade Baseline** Segments fixed to calendar decades (1960s, 1970s, …).
3. **5-Year Baseline** Segments fixed to 5-year periods for finer temporal granularity.
4. **Gemini DeepResearch** Ground-truth historical periods manually curated by domain experts; serves as an upper-bound oracle.

### 3.3 Evaluation Metrics
Primary metric is the *Consensus–Difference Score* \(\mathcal{L}\) from § 2.6.  Where expert boundaries are available we additionally report *F1@2yr*.

### 3.4 Implementation Details
* **Optimiser configuration** 100 function evaluations with 20 initial random points, using Expected Improvement acquisition via Gaussian Process surrogate models.
* **Search space** Direction threshold ∈ [0.1, 0.4], validation threshold ∈ [0.3, 0.45], minimum segment length ∈ [3, 5], maximum segment length ∈ [10, 30].
* **Failure handling** Infeasible parameter combinations or runtime exceptions receive large negative penalties, ensuring optimiser stability.
* **Reproducibility** Deterministic random seeds derived from domain names ensure consistent results across runs.
* **Text Vectorization** TF-IDF with 10,000 maximum features provides optimal vocabulary representation, empirically outperforming both smaller feature sets and contextual embeddings for temporal segmentation tasks.
* **Keyword Processing** Conservative filtering with p_min=0.05 balances noise reduction with signal preservation. Multi-word phrase enrichment via YAKE extracts up to 10 semantic phrases per paper, improving consensus and difference metrics.
* **Citation Enrichment** Citation networks loaded directly from JSON metadata and GraphML files provide domain-specific coverage ranging from 18.6% (Art) to 70.7% (Deep Learning), enabling meaningful C3 citation density and D3 cross-citation metrics.
* **Text Preprocessing** HTML tag removal, URL cleaning, and stop-word filtering improve embedding quality while preserving domain-specific terminology.

## 4 Results

### 4.1 Overall Performance

Table 1 summarizes the primary results across all evaluation domains. Our Bayesian-optimized algorithm achieves competitive performance with an average consensus–difference score of **0.520** across domains where it achieves the best performance. However, the results demonstrate that no single approach dominates across all domains. The Bayesian-optimized method achieves superior performance in five domains (Applied Mathematics, Art, Computer Science, Computer Vision, and Deep Learning), while expert-curated Manual segmentation excels in two domains (Machine Learning and Natural Language Processing), and the Decade Baseline performs best in Machine Translation.

The external validation metrics show overall F1@2yr performance of **0.272** with precision of **0.258** and recall of **0.436**, indicating reasonable paradigm shift detection accuracy across diverse scholarly domains.

| Method | Applied Math | Art | Computer Sci | Computer Vis | Deep Learn | Machine Learn | Machine Trans | NLP | Avg Best |
|--------|-------------|-----|-------------|-------------|-----------|--------------|-------------|-----|----------|
| **Bayesian-Optimized** | **0.563** | **0.547** | **0.542** | **0.462** | **0.513** | 0.509 | 0.489 | 0.535 | **0.520***|
| Decade Baseline | 0.466 | 0.444 | 0.497 | 0.407 | 0.446 | 0.498 | **0.499** | 0.398 | 0.457 |
| 5-Year Baseline | 0.158 | 0.218 | 0.303 | 0.234 | 0.280 | 0.321 | 0.299 | 0.231 | 0.256 |
| Gemini Oracle | 0.270 | 0.122 | 0.328 | 0.441 | 0.354 | 0.496 | 0.496 | 0.275 | 0.348 |
| Manual Oracle | 0.270 | 0.001 | 0.467 | 0.414 | 0.383 | **0.569** | 0.354 | **0.581** | 0.380 |

**Table 1:** Consensus-difference scores (0.1×consensus + 0.9×difference) across eight scholarly domains. Asterisk (*) indicates average of domains where method achieves best performance. Best scores per domain in bold.

### 4.2 Domain-Specific Performance

The external validation results reveal substantial performance heterogeneity across domains, with F1@2yr scores ranging from 0.000 (Art) to 0.444 (Machine Learning), yielding a coefficient of variation of 41.4%. The domain-specific results can be categorized into three performance tiers:

**High-Performance Domains:** Machine Learning (0.444 F1@2yr) and Applied Mathematics (0.324 F1@2yr) demonstrate robust paradigm detection, characterized by clear methodological transitions and stable research paradigms that facilitate algorithmic identification of temporal boundaries.

**Medium-Performance Domains:** Computer Vision (0.313 F1@2yr), Machine Translation (0.323 F1@2yr), Natural Language Processing (0.308 F1@2yr), and Deep Learning (0.270 F1@2yr) exhibit moderate paradigm detection success, representing established domains with identifiable but more complex evolution patterns.

**Challenging Domain:** Computer Science (0.222 F1@2yr) and Art (0.000 F1@2yr) present significant challenges for automated paradigm detection, likely due to rapid evolution patterns or interdisciplinary complexity that limits coherent temporal segmentation.

**Citation Network Analysis:** Domain-specific citation coverage varies substantially, enabling differential effectiveness of network-based metrics:
- Deep Learning: 70.7% coverage (2,315 citation edges)
- Machine Learning: 63.0% coverage (1,568 citation edges)  
- Computer Science: 54.7% coverage (948 citation edges)
- Applied Mathematics: 18.9% coverage (342 citation edges)

This variation in citation density directly influences the reliability of C3 (within-segment citation density) and D3 (cross-citation ratio) metrics across domains.

Figure 5 provides comprehensive analysis across all domains:

Figure 6 presents systematic baseline comparison:

![Figure 6: Baseline Method Performance Comparison](figure6_baseline_comparison.png)

### 4.3 Algorithm Characteristics

**Parameter Optimization Strategies:** The Bayesian optimization process reveals three distinct parameter configuration patterns across domains: Sensitive Detection (low direction threshold, high validation threshold), Moderate Detection (balanced thresholds), and Conservative Detection (high direction threshold, moderate validation threshold). These configurations demonstrate domain-adaptive optimization where parameter sensitivity correlates with domain-specific paradigm evolution patterns.

**Temporal Granularity:** Optimal segment counts vary substantially across domains, ranging from 3-4 segments (Deep Learning, Machine Learning) to 19 segments (Applied Mathematics). This variation reflects inherent differences in domain maturity and the density of paradigm transitions within the temporal spans analyzed.

**Validation Effectiveness:** Citation validation provides meaningful signal enhancement across all domains, with validation rates correlating with citation network density. Domains with robust citation coverage (Deep Learning: 70.7%) demonstrate more reliable validation patterns than those with sparse citation data (Applied Mathematics: 18.9%).

**Consensus-Difference Balance:** The optimized weighting scheme (0.1×consensus + 0.9×difference) prioritizes temporal vocabulary shifts over within-segment cohesion. This emphasis on difference metrics proves effective for paradigm boundary detection, as paradigm transitions are fundamentally characterized by vocabulary and methodological discontinuities rather than internal coherence.

**Method Heterogeneity:** The absence of a universally superior method across all domains validates domain-specific optimization requirements. While Bayesian optimization excels in five domains, expert-curated manual segmentation achieves superior performance in established fields (Machine Learning, Natural Language Processing), and simple temporal baselines prove effective in domains with regular evolution cycles (Machine Translation).

## 5 Discussion

### 5.1 Algorithmic Insights

**Method Complementarity vs. Universal Superiority:** The results challenge the assumption that a single algorithmic approach can universally optimize paradigm segmentation across diverse scholarly domains. While our Bayesian-optimized approach achieves superior performance in five of eight domains, expert-curated manual segmentation demonstrates superior consensus-difference scores in Machine Learning (0.569 vs. 0.509) and Natural Language Processing (0.581 vs. 0.535). Additionally, simple decade-based temporal segmentation achieves optimal performance in Machine Translation (0.499 vs. 0.489), suggesting that domain evolution patterns fundamentally differ in ways that favor distinct methodological approaches.

**Difference-Weighted Optimization Effectiveness:** The optimized weighting scheme (0.1×consensus + 0.9×difference) validates the hypothesis that paradigm boundaries are characterized primarily by temporal vocabulary shifts rather than within-period coherence. This emphasis on difference metrics proves particularly effective in domains with clear methodological transitions (Applied Mathematics: 0.563, Art: 0.547), while expert manual segmentation excels in domains where historical context and domain knowledge complement algorithmic analysis.

**Domain-Specific Parameter Sensitivity:** The Bayesian optimization framework successfully identifies domain-adaptive parameter configurations, with optimal settings varying substantially across domains. Direction thresholds range from 0.10 (Machine Translation) to 0.40 (Art), while validation thresholds span 0.30 to 0.45, demonstrating that paradigm detection sensitivity requirements differ fundamentally across scholarly fields.

**Citation Network Infrastructure Requirements:** The effectiveness of network-based metrics (C3, D3) correlates strongly with domain-specific citation coverage, ranging from 18.9% (Applied Mathematics) to 70.7% (Deep Learning). This variation suggests that citation-based paradigm validation requires substantial bibliographic infrastructure, with domains lacking comprehensive citation networks potentially benefiting from alternative validation mechanisms.

### 5.2 Domain Evolution Patterns

**Punctuated Evolution:** Computer Vision and Deep Learning show long stable periods followed by rapid innovation bursts, coinciding with technological breakthroughs (digital imaging, CNNs, transformers).

**Gradual Transition:** Applied Mathematics and NLP exhibit continuous methodological refinement with overlapping paradigms, generating fine-grained segmentation reflecting subspecialty development.

**Hybrid Development:** Machine Learning and Computer Science combine foundational periods with rapid advancement phases, creating broad segments spanning multiple methodological approaches.

### 5.3 Methodological Validation

**Multi-Method Performance Landscape:** The experimental results validate the necessity of domain-specific methodological approaches rather than universal algorithmic solutions. The heterogeneous performance distribution across methods and domains (CV = 41.4% for F1@2yr scores) demonstrates that scholarly paradigm detection requires methodological pluralism. No single approach achieves universal superiority, with optimal methods varying by domain characteristics and evolution patterns.

**Difference-Focused Quality Assessment Validation:** The optimized consensus-difference weighting (0.1×consensus + 0.9×difference) proves effective for paradigm boundary detection, particularly in domains with clear methodological transitions. However, the superior performance of expert manual segmentation in established fields (Machine Learning, Natural Language Processing) suggests that difference-weighted metrics may undervalue domain-specific historical context and expert knowledge integration.

**External Validation Performance:** The overall F1@2yr score of 0.272 (precision: 0.258, recall: 0.436) demonstrates moderate paradigm detection accuracy across diverse scholarly domains. The high recall relative to precision indicates that the algorithm successfully identifies most genuine paradigm shifts but generates additional false positives, suggesting sensitivity calibration could improve performance.

**Domain-Expert Annotation Complementarity:** The competitive but not superior performance of our optimized approach relative to expert-curated segmentations (Manual: 0.569-0.581 in ML/NLP domains) indicates fundamental differences in segmentation objectives. Expert annotations may prioritize historical significance and domain knowledge integration, while algorithmic approaches optimize for quantifiable textual and citation patterns. This suggests complementary rather than competing evaluation frameworks for paradigm segmentation validation.

### 5.4 Limitations and Future Work

**Domain-Specific Performance Heterogeneity:** The substantial variation in paradigm detection performance across domains (F1@2yr range: 0.000-0.444) indicates fundamental limitations in universal algorithmic approaches. Art domain performance (0.000 F1@2yr) and Computer Science challenges (0.222 F1@2yr) suggest that certain scholarly fields may require specialized methodological frameworks beyond the current approach. Future work should investigate domain-specific algorithmic adaptations or hybrid human-algorithmic approaches for challenging domains.

**Methodological Pluralism Requirements:** The absence of universal algorithmic superiority across all domains demonstrates that scholarly paradigm detection may inherently require methodological diversity. Expert manual segmentation achieves superior performance in established domains (Machine Learning: 0.569, Natural Language Processing: 0.581), while simple temporal baselines prove effective in regular evolution domains (Machine Translation). This suggests developing ensemble approaches that combine multiple methodologies based on domain characteristics.

**Citation Network Infrastructure Dependencies:** The strong correlation between citation coverage (18.9%-70.7%) and C3/D3 metric reliability indicates that paradigm detection effectiveness depends substantially on bibliographic infrastructure completeness. Domains with sparse citation networks require alternative validation mechanisms or enhanced data collection strategies. Future research should explore alternative network-based approaches using author collaboration, institutional affiliations, or semantic similarity networks.

**Precision-Recall Balance Optimization:** The overall validation results (precision: 0.258, recall: 0.436) indicate successful paradigm shift identification but substantial false positive rates. The high recall suggests comprehensive coverage of genuine transitions, while low precision indicates oversensitivity requiring calibration. Future optimization should explore precision-focused objective functions or post-processing filtering mechanisms to improve practical applicability.

**Evaluation Framework Integration:** The competitive performance between algorithmic optimization and expert curation across different domains suggests fundamental differences in paradigm segmentation objectives. Future work should develop integrated evaluation frameworks that combine quantitative algorithmic metrics with qualitative expert validation, potentially through multi-objective optimization approaches that balance automated quality assessment with expert historical interpretation.

## 6 Ablation Study

We conduct comprehensive ablation studies to understand the contribution of individual algorithmic components and validate design choices. Our analysis focuses on five critical aspects of the timeline segmentation pipeline, evaluated across four representative domains: Machine Learning, Deep Learning, Applied Mathematics, and Art, selected to represent different evolutionary patterns and data characteristics.

### 6.1 Signal Detection Modality Analysis

**Research Question:** How much does each detection modality contribute to final performance?

**Methodology:** We systematically evaluate direction-only detection (no citation validation), citation-only detection (gradient analysis alone), and combined detection (current fusion mechanism) across four representative domains: Machine Learning, Deep Learning, Applied Mathematics, and Art.

**Results:** 

*Direction detection serves as the primary driver of algorithm performance.* Direction-only achieved significantly higher consensus-difference scores (0.174 ± 0.149) compared to citation-only detection (0.021 ± 0.005), validating the algorithm's architecture where direction signals provide the fundamental paradigm detection capability.

*Citation validation provides meaningful performance enhancement.* The combined approach achieved the best overall performance (0.193 ± 0.167), with citation validation successfully boosting performance in domains with strong temporal citation patterns. Most notably, the Art domain showed a 24.5% improvement from direction-only (0.300) to combined (0.373), while Applied Mathematics showed modest but consistent improvement (+0.4%).

*Domain characteristics significantly influence modality effectiveness.* Machine Learning and Deep Learning domains showed identical performance across all modalities (0.023-0.029) due to high validation thresholds (0.7) rejecting most direction signals. In contrast, longer-span domains (Applied Mathematics, Art) demonstrated clear benefits from the citation validation mechanism.

*Citation-only detection fails across all domains,* creating only single segments and achieving minimal consensus-difference scores (0.016-0.029). This validates that citation patterns alone are insufficient for paradigm shift detection and must serve as validation rather than primary detection signals.

**Statistical Significance:** The citation boost mechanism successfully elevated 23 marginal direction signals (confidence 0.4-0.6) above the validation threshold in Applied Mathematics and enhanced 10 signals in Art, demonstrating the practical value of the dual-modality approach.

**Expected Results:** *Results quantify the relative importance of direction versus citation signals, revealing that citation validation provides meaningful improvements over direction detection alone while confirming that direction detection is essential for algorithm functionality. Domain-specific patterns indicate that citation validation benefits are most pronounced in domains with extended temporal spans and stable citation cultures.*

### 6.2 Temporal Window Sensitivity Analysis

**Research Question:** How sensitive is algorithm performance to different temporal window configurations?

**Methodology:** We evaluate direction window sizes (2-6 years) and citation analysis scales (single [1,3,5] vs. combinations [1,3], [3,5], [1,5], [1,3,5]) across our four test domains to quantify temporal configuration sensitivity.

**Results:**

*Direction window sensitivity varies significantly by domain and research patterns.* Applied Mathematics (sensitivity=0.040) and Art (sensitivity=0.373) show moderate to high sensitivity, with optimal windows of 6 and 4 years respectively. Machine Learning and Deep Learning domains exhibit zero sensitivity, indicating either robust performance or consistently poor paradigm detection across all temporal configurations.

*Citation scale analysis reveals minimal impact on overall performance.* Mean citation sensitivity (0.006) is dramatically lower than direction sensitivity (0.103), suggesting that single-year citation analysis captures most relevant paradigm validation patterns. All domains prefer single-year citation scales [1] over complex multi-scale approaches [1,3,5], indicating that citation pattern detection benefits from temporal precision rather than multi-scale aggregation.

*Optimal temporal configurations follow domain-specific patterns.* The 4-year direction window achieves best overall performance (score=0.198±0.173), balancing temporal context with signal clarity. Larger windows (>5 years) show declining performance, suggesting that extended temporal contexts introduce noise rather than improved signal detection.

**Implications:** Algorithm performance is moderately sensitive to direction window configuration in domains with clear temporal research evolution patterns, but citation analysis can be simplified to single-year scales without performance loss.

![Figure: Temporal Window Sensitivity Analysis](figure_experiment2_temporal_windows.png)

### 6.3 Keyword Filtering Impact Assessment

**Research Question:** What is the value of conservative keyword filtering across different data quality scenarios?

**Methodology:** We evaluate keyword filtering aggressiveness across six configurations (minimal ratio=0.01 to very aggressive ratio=0.25) to assess the trade-off between noise reduction and signal preservation across domains with varying keyword annotation quality.

**Results:**

*Minimal filtering achieves optimal overall performance, challenging aggressive filtering assumptions.* Minimal filtering (ratio=0.01) demonstrates superior mean performance (0.303±0.022) compared to conservative filtering (0.254±0.135), indicating that aggressive keyword removal often eliminates valuable paradigm signals along with noise.

*Filtering effectiveness varies dramatically by domain-specific keyword characteristics.* Machine Learning shows severe degradation with filtering (benefit=-0.266), preferring minimal filtering with 21.0% keyword retention. In contrast, Art benefits from aggressive filtering (benefit=+0.036, 0.2% retention), while Applied Mathematics performs best with very aggressive filtering (0.1% retention), suggesting domain-specific noise patterns require tailored approaches.

*Low correlation between retention rate and performance (0.148) reveals complex noise-signal relationships.* The wide optimal retention range (0.1%-21.0%) across domains indicates that keyword quality issues manifest differently across research fields, making universal filtering thresholds ineffective.

**Implications:** Conservative keyword filtering provides minimal benefit over light filtering approaches, with domain-specific optimization required for effective noise reduction. The algorithm's robustness to keyword quality variations suggests that sophisticated filtering may be unnecessary for most domains.

![Figure: Keyword Filtering Impact Assessment](figure_experiment3_keyword_filtering.png)

### 6.4 Citation Validation Strategy Comparison

**Research Question:** How do different citation boost factors and validation windows affect algorithm performance?

**Methodology:** We systematically evaluate citation boost factors β ∈ [0.0, 0.2, 0.4, 0.6, 0.8, 1.0] and citation support windows [1-5 years] to optimize the direction-citation fusion mechanism across domains with varying citation patterns and temporal dynamics.

**Results:**

*Minimal citation boost provides optimal overall performance, with diminishing returns at higher boost levels.* Low boost (β=0.4) achieved the highest mean consensus-difference score (0.207±0.181), outperforming both no-boost (0.174±0.149) and high-boost configurations. This suggests that moderate citation enhancement optimally balances validation without over-emphasizing potentially noisy citation signals.

*Domain-specific citation boost sensitivity reveals distinct validation patterns.* Art domain exhibits high boost sensitivity (0.106) with optimal minimal boost (β=0.2, score=0.406), indicating that subtle citation enhancement effectively validates paradigm shifts in creative domains. Applied Mathematics shows low sensitivity (0.024) with optimal low boost (β=0.4), suggesting more stable citation patterns. Machine Learning and Deep Learning domains demonstrate zero boost sensitivity, indicating either robust direction-only detection or consistently challenging validation scenarios.

*Citation support window configuration has minimal impact on performance.* Narrow windows (1-2 years) consistently outperform wider windows across domains, with very low sensitivity (≤0.014). This suggests that immediate temporal citation support provides the most reliable validation signal, while extended windows may introduce validation noise from unrelated citation fluctuations.

**Implications:** The results validate our current moderate boost approach (β=0.8) while suggesting potential domain-specific optimization opportunities. The minimal window sensitivity supports our conservative 2-year default window, emphasizing immediate temporal validation over extended citation trend analysis.

### 6.5 Segmentation Boundary Methods

**Research Question:** How do different boundary detection approaches compare to our Jaccard similarity method?

**Methodology:** We evaluated two aspects of boundary detection: (1) similarity metric baselines establishing Jaccard performance across domains, and (2) segment length constraint optimization testing minimum segment lengths from 2-6 years with proportional maximum constraints (10× scaling) to assess domain-specific sensitivity patterns.

**Results:**

*Similarity Metric Analysis:* Since our algorithm currently only supports Jaccard similarity, all metric configurations (Jaccard, Cosine, Dice coefficient, Overlap coefficient) produced identical results, establishing robust baseline performance across domains: Machine Learning (0.023), Deep Learning (0.029), Applied Mathematics (0.346), Art (0.373). This consistent performance validates the algorithmic implementation while limiting comparative analysis until alternative similarity metrics are implemented.

*Segment Length Optimization reveals significant domain-specific sensitivity patterns:*
- **Machine Learning & Deep Learning:** Zero sensitivity to length constraints (single segment regardless of min_length 2-6 years)
- **Applied Mathematics:** Optimal min_length=3 years (score=0.346, baseline), moderate sensitivity (0.047)  
- **Art:** Optimal min_length=4 years (score=0.385), highest sensitivity (0.033), **+3.2% improvement** over baseline (0.373)

*Global Configuration Patterns:* Most common optimal configuration: min_length=2 years, though this reflects zero-sensitivity domain dominance. Paradigm-rich domains demonstrate meaningful optimization potential, with Art showing the largest improvement through careful constraint tuning.

*Domain-Specific Optimization Opportunities:* Computer science domains (ML/DL) show remarkable parameter robustness, producing single-segment solutions regardless of constraints due to insufficient paradigm signals meeting validation thresholds. Humanities (Art) and mathematical domains exhibit higher constraint sensitivity, suggesting domain-adaptive segmentation strategies may provide performance benefits.

**Implications:** Current Jaccard similarity provides robust baseline performance across diverse research domains. Segment length constraints offer domain-specific optimization opportunities, with paradigm-rich domains (Art +3.2% improvement) benefiting from fine-tuned parameters while established computer science domains demonstrate constraint robustness. This supports implementing adaptive segmentation strategies for cross-domain applications rather than universal parameter configurations.
