Deeper neural networks are more difficult to train. We present a residual learning framework ease the training of that substantially deeper than those used previously. explicitly reformulate layers as functions with reference layer inputs, instead unreferenced functions. provide comprehensive empirical evidence showing these easier optimize, and can gain accuracy from considerably increased depth. On ImageNet dataset we evaluate nets depth up 152 - 8× VGG [40] but still having lower complexity. An ensemble achieves 3.57% error on test set. This result won 1st place ILSVRC 2015 classification task. also analysis CIFAR-10 100 1000 layers. The representations is central importance for many visual recognition tasks. Solely due our extremely deep representations, obtain 28% relative improvement COCO object detection dataset. Deep foundations submissions & competitions1, where places tasks detection, localization, segmentation.

We propose a deep convolutional neural network architecture codenamed Inception that achieves the new state of art for classification and detection in ImageNet Large-Scale Visual Recognition Challenge 2014 (ILSVRC14). The main hallmark this is improved utilization computing resources inside network. By carefully crafted design, we increased depth width while keeping computational budget constant.

Object detection performance, as measured on the canonical PASCAL VOC dataset, has plateaued in last few years. The best-performing methods are complex ensemble systems that typically combine multiple low-level image features with high-level context. In this paper, we propose a simple and scalable algorithm improves mean average precision (mAP) by more than 30% relative to previous best result 2012 -- achieving mAP of 53.3%. Our approach combines two key insights: (1) one can apply high-capacity convolutional neural networks (CNNs) bottom-up region proposals order localize segment objects (2) when labeled training data is scarce, supervised pre-training for an auxiliary task, followed domain-specific fine-tuning, yields significant performance boost. Since CNNs, call our method R-CNN: Regions CNN features.

Gradient Boosting Decision Tree (GBDT) is a popular machine learning algorithm, and has quite few effective implementations such as XGBoost pGBRT. Although many engineering optimizations have been adopted in these implementations, the efficiency scalability are still unsatisfactory when feature dimension high data size large. A major reason that for each feature, they need to scan all instances estimate information gain of possible split points, which very time consuming. To tackle this problem, we propose two novel techniques: Gradient-based One-Side Sampling (GOSS) Exclusive Feature Bundling (EFB). With GOSS, exclude significant proportion with small gradients, only use rest gain. We prove that, since larger gradients play more important role computation gain, GOSS can obtain accurate estimation much smaller size.

Unsupervised learning with generative adversarial networks (GANs) has proven hugely successful. Regular GANs hypothesize the discriminator as a classifier sigmoid cross entropy loss function. However, we found that this function may lead to vanishing gradients problem during process. To overcome such problem, propose in paper Least Squares Generative Adversarial Networks (LSGANs) which adopt least squares for discriminator. We show minimizing objective of LSGAN yields Pearson X2 divergence. There are two benefits LSGANs over regular GANs. First, able generate higher quality images than Second, perform more stable evaluate on LSUN and CIFAR-10 datasets experimental results generated by better ones also conduct comparison experiments between illustrate stability LSGANs.

Different from Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and Linear Discriminant (LDA) which effectively see only Euclidean structure of space, LPP finds embedding that preserves local information, obtains best detects essential manifold structure. The Laplacianfaces optimal linear approximations to eigenfunctions Laplace Beltrami operator on manifold. In this way, unwanted variations resulting changes in lighting, facial expression, pose may be eliminated or reduced. Theoretical analysis shows PCA, LDA, can obtained different graph models. compare proposed approach with Eigenface Fisherface methods three data sets. Experimental results suggest provides better representation achieves lower error rates recognition.

Many deep neural networks trained on natural images exhibit a curious phenomenon in common: the first layer they learn features similar to Gabor filters and color blobs. Such first-layer appear not be specific particular dataset or task, but general that are applicable many datasets tasks. Features must eventually transition from by last of network, this has been studied extensively. In paper we experimentally quantify generality versus specificity neurons each convolutional network report few surprising results. Transferability is negatively affected two distinct issues: (1) specialization higher their original task at expense performance target which was expected, (2) optimization difficulties related splitting between co-adapted neurons, expected. an example ImageNet, demonstrate either these issues may dominate, depending whether transferred bottom, middle, top network. We also document transferability decreases as distance base increases, transferring even distant tasks can better than using random features. A final result initializing with almost any number layers produce boost generalization lingers after fine-tuning dataset.

We introduce the ""exponential linear unit"" (ELU) which speeds up learning in deep neural networks and leads to higher classification accuracies. Like rectified units (ReLUs), leaky ReLUs (LReLUs) parametrized (PReLUs), ELUs alleviate vanishing gradient problem via identity for positive values. However, have improved characteristics compared with other activation functions. In contrast ReLUs, negative values allows them push mean unit activations closer zero like batch normalization but lower computational complexity. Mean shifts toward speed by bringing normal natural because of a reduced bias shift effect. While LReLUs PReLUs values, too, they do not ensure noise-robust deactivation state. saturate value smaller inputs thereby decrease forward propagated variation information. Therefore, code degree presence particular phenomena input, while quantitatively model their absence. experiments, lead only faster learning, also significantly better generalization performance than on more 5 layers.

Existing state-of-the-art frameworks first encode the input image a low-resolution representation through subnetwork that is formed by connecting high-to-low resolution convolutions <i>in series</i> (e.g., ResNet, VGGNet), then recover high-resolution from encoded representation. Instead, our proposed network, named High-Resolution Network (HRNet), maintains whole process.

Convolutional networks are powerful visual models that yield hierarchies of features. We show convolutional by themselves, trained end-to-end, pixels-to-pixels, exceed the state-of-the-art in semantic segmentation. Our key insight is to build ""fully convolutional"" take input arbitrary size and produce correspondingly-sized output with efficient inference learning. define detail space fully networks, explain their application spatially dense prediction tasks, draw connections prior models. adapt contemporary classification (AlexNet, VGG net, GoogLeNet) into transfer learned representations fine-tuning segmentation task. then a novel architecture combines information from deep, coarse layer appearance shallow, fine accurate detailed segmentations. network achieves PASCAL VOC (20% relative improvement 62.2% mean IU on 2012), NYUDv2, SIFT Flow, while takes one third second for typical image.

Visual object tracking has been a fundamental topic in recent years and many deep learning based trackers have achieved state-of-the-art performance on multiple benchmarks. However, most of these can hardly get top with real-time speed. In this paper, we propose the Siamese region proposal network (Siamese-RPN) which is end-to-end trained off-line large-scale image pairs. Specifically, it consists subnetwork for feature extraction including classification branch regression branch. inference phase, proposed framework formulated as local one-shot detection task. We pre-compute template formulate correlation layers trivial convolution to perform online tracking. Benefit from refinement, traditional multi-scale test fine-tuning be discarded. The Siamese-RPN runs at 160 FPS while achieving leading VOT2015, VOT2016 VOT2017 challenges.

Learning from a few examples remains key challenge in machine learning. Despite recent advances important domains such as vision and language, the standard supervised deep learning paradigm does not offer satisfactory solution for new concepts rapidly little data. In this work, we employ ideas metric based on neural features that augment networks with external memories. Our framework learns network maps small labelled support set an unlabelled example to its label, obviating need fine-tuning adapt class types. We then define one-shot problems (using Omniglot, ImageNet) language tasks. algorithm improves accuracy ImageNet 87.6% 93.2% 88.0% 93.8% Omniglot compared competing approaches. also demonstrate usefulness of same model modeling by introducing task Penn Treebank.
