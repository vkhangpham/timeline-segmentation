Creativity is about capturing those moments that make life worth living. The author's objective to offer an understanding of what leads these moments, be it the excitement artist at easel or scientist in lab, so knowledge can used enrich people's lives. Drawing on 100 interviews with exceptional people, from biologists and physicists politicians business leaders, poets artists, as well his 30 years research subject, Csikszentmihalyi uses famous theory explore creative process. He discusses such ideas why individuals are often seen selfish arrogant, tortured genius largely a myth. Most important, he clearly explains creativity needs cultivated necessary for future our country, if not world.Accessible enjoyable reading. --Washington Times Although benefits this study scholars obvious, thought-provoking mixture scholarly colloquial will enlighten inquisitive general readers, too. --Library Journal (starred review)

Recent deep learning based approaches have shown promising results for the challenging task of inpainting large missing regions in an image. These methods can generate visually plausible image structures and textures, but often create distorted or blurry textures inconsistent with surrounding areas. This is mainly due to ineffectiveness convolutional neural networks explicitly borrowing copying information from distant spatial locations. On other hand, traditional texture patch synthesis are particularly suitable when it needs borrow regions. Motivated by these observations, we propose a new generative model-based approach which not only synthesize novel also utilize features as references during network training make better predictions. The model feedforward, fully process images multiple holes at arbitrary locations variable sizes test time. Experiments on datasets including faces (CelebA, CelebA-HQ), (DTD) natural (ImageNet, Places2) demonstrate that our proposed generates higher-quality than existing ones.

Rather than focusing on identity assignment, we make inferring attributes core problem recognition. These can be semantic (""spotty"") discriminative (""dogs have it sheep do not"").

Many definitions used in medically assisted reproduction (MAR) vary different settings, making it difficult to standardize and compare procedures countries regions. With the expansion of infertility interventions worldwide, including lower resource importance value a common nomenclature is critical. The objective develop an internationally accepted continually updated set definitions, which would be utilized harmonize international data collection, assist monitoring availability, efficacy, safety reproductive technology (ART) being practiced worldwide.Seventy-two clinicians, basic scientists, epidemiologists social scientists gathered together at WHO headquarters Geneva, Switzerland December, 2008.

Perceptual systems routinely separate ""content"" from ""style,"" classifying familiar words spoken in an unfamiliar accent, identifying a font or handwriting style across letters, recognizing face object seen under viewing conditions. Yet general and tractable computational model of this ability to untangle the underlying factors perceptual observations remains elusive (Hofstadter, 1985). Existing factor models (Mardia, Kent, & Bibby, 1979; Hinton Zemel, 1994; Ghahramani, 1995; Bell Sejnowski, Hinton, Dayan, Frey, Neal, 1997) are either insufficiently rich capture complex interactions perceptually meaningful such as phoneme speaker accent letter font, do not allow efficient learning algorithms. We present framework for solve two-factor tasks using bilinear models, which provide sufficiently expressive representations but can nonetheless be fit data algorithms based on singular value decomposition expectation-maximization. report promising results three different domains: vowel classification with benchmark multi-speaker database, extrapolation fonts unseen translation faces novel illuminants.

ABSTRACT Nineteenth century science neglected creativity, and the limited twentieth approach (to 1950) was largely anecdotal. Recently, research has multiplied, although it involved little experimental hypothesis testing. Creativity comprises many discrete abilities which often do not correlate very much with each other, creativity IQ substantially only at lower levels. Much work been done in developing evaluative criteria for creative scientific production, on teaching learning creativity. Future basic should concern transfer recall, transformations, reclassification, elaboration, incubation, environmental conditions, motivation. The social consequences of releasing are potentially enormous.

In this paper we have discussed what appears to be a superior implementation of the Algebraic Reconstruction Technique (ART). The method is based on 1) simultaneous application error correction terms as computed by ART for all rays in given projection; 2) longitudinal weighting back-distributed along rays; and 3) using bilinear elements discrete approximation ray integrals continuous image. Since generates good reconstruction only one iteration, it also computational advantage over more traditional ART. Potential applications include image conjunction with tracing ultrasound microwave tomography which curved nature leads non-uniform density across

With the rise in popularity of digital cameras, amount visual data available on web is growing exponentially. Some these pictures are extremely beautiful and aesthetically pleasing, but vast majority uninteresting or low quality. This paper demonstrates a simple, yet powerful method to automatically select high aesthetic quality images from large image collections. Our estimation explicitly predicts some possible cues that human might use evaluate an then uses them discriminative approach. These level describable attributes fall into three broad types: 1) compositional related layout configuration, 2) content objects scene types depicted, 3) sky-illumination natural lighting conditions. We demonstrate aesthetics classifier trained can provide significant improvement over baseline methods for predicting judgments. also our ""interestingness"" Flickr photos, introduce novel problem estimating query specific ""interestingness"".

Algebraic reconstruction techniques (ART) were introduced by Gordon et al. (1970) for solving the problem of three dimensional from projections in electron microscopy and radiology. An X-ray photograph represents projection three-dimensional distribution densities within body onto a two-dimensional plane. A finite number such photographs taken at different angles allows one to reconstruct an estimate original 3-D densities. The ART algorithms this have simple intuitive basis. Each projected density is thrown back across higher region whence it came, with repeated corrections bring each into agreement corresponding measured projection.
