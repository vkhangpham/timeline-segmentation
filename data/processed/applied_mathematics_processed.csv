Generalized gradient approximations (GGA's) for the exchange-correlation energy improve upon local spin density (LSD) description of atoms, molecules, and solids. We present a simple derivation GGA, in which all parameters (other than those LSD) are fundamental constants. Only general features detailed construction underlying Perdew-Wang 1991 (PW91) GGA invoked. Improvements over PW91 include an accurate linear response uniform electron gas, correct behavior under scaling, smoother potential.

We present an efficient scheme for calculating the Kohn-Sham ground state of metallic systems using pseudopotentials and a plane-wave basis set. In first part application Pulay's DIIS method (direct inversion in iterative subspace) to diagonalization large matrices will be discussed. Our approach is stable, reliable, minimizes number order ${\mathit{N}}_{\mathrm{atoms}}^{3}$ operations. second part, we discuss mixing also based on scheme. A special ``metric'' ``preconditioning'' optimized set introduced. Scaling discussed detail non-self-consistent self-consistent calculations. It shown that iterations required obtain specific precision almost independent system size. Altogether ${\mathit{N}}_{\mathrm{atoms}}^{2}$ scaling found containing up 1000 electrons. If take into account k points can decreased linearly with size, overall ${\mathit{N}}_{\mathrm{atoms}}$. have implemented these algorithms within powerful package called VASP (Vienna ab initio simulation package). The program techniques been used successfully different (liquid amorphous semiconductors, liquid simple transition metals, semiconducting surfaces, phonons semiconductors) turned out very reliable. \textcopyright{} 1996 American Physical Society.

From a theory of Hohenberg and Kohn, approximation methods for treating an inhomogeneous system interacting electrons are developed. These exact systems slowly varying or high density. For the ground state, they lead to self-consistent equations analogous Hartree Hartree-Fock equations, respectively. In these exchange correlation portions chemical potential uniform electron gas appear as additional effective potentials. (The portion our differs from that due Slater by factor $\frac{2}{3}$.) Electronic at finite temperatures in magnetic fields also treated similar methods. An appendix deals with further correction short-wavelength density oscillations.

Abstract When large multivariate datasets are analyzed, it is often desirable to reduce their dimensionality. Principal component analysis one technique for doing this. It replaces the p original variables by a smaller number, q , of derived variables, principal components, which linear combinations variables. Often, possible retain most variability in with very much than . Despite its apparent simplicity, has number subtleties, and many uses extensions. A choices associated briefly discussed, namely, covariance or correlation, how different normalization constraints, as well confusion factor analysis. Various extensions outlined.

Many areas of science depend on exploratory data analysis and visualization. The need to analyze large amounts multivariate raises the fundamental problem dimensionality reduction: how discover compact representations high-dimensional data. Here, we introduce locally linear embedding (LLE), an unsupervised learning algorithm that computes low-dimensional, neighborhood-preserving embeddings inputs. Unlike clustering methods for local reduction, LLE maps its inputs into a single global coordinate system lower dimensionality, optimizations do not involve minima. By exploiting symmetries reconstructions, is able learn structure nonlinear manifolds, such as those generated by images faces or documents text.

This methods, which can be viewed as an extension classical gradient algorithm, is attractive due to its simplicity and thus adequate large-scale even with dense matrix data. However, such methods are also known converge quite slowly. In this paper we present a new fast algorithm (FISTA) preserves computational ISTA but global rate convergence proven significantly better, both theoretically practically. Initial promising numerical results wavelet-based image deblurring demonstrate capabilities FISTA shown faster than by several orders magnitude.

Conventional approaches to sampling signals or images follow Shannon's theorem: the rate must be at least twice maximum frequency present in signal (Nyquist rate). In field of data conversion, standard analog-to-digital converter (ADC) technology implements usual quantized Shannon representation - is uniformly sampled above Nyquist rate. This article surveys theory compressive sampling, also known as compressed sensing CS, a novel sensing/sampling paradigm that goes against common wisdom acquisition. CS asserts one can recover certain and from far fewer samples measurements than traditional methods use.

In recent years there has been a growing interest in the study of sparse representation signals. Using an overcomplete dictionary that contains prototype signal-atoms, signals are described by linear combinations these atoms. Applications use many and include compression, regularization inverse problems, feature extraction, more. Recent activity this field concentrated mainly on pursuit algorithms decompose with respect to given dictionary. Designing dictionaries better fit above model can be done either selecting one from prespecified set transforms or adapting training Both techniques have considered, but topic is largely still open. paper we propose novel algorithm for order achieve signal representations. Given signals, seek leads best each member set, under strict sparsity constraints.

Support vector machines (SVMs) were originally designed for binary classification. How to effectively extend it multiclass classification is still an ongoing research issue. Several methods have been proposed where typically we construct a classifier by combining several classifiers. Some authors also that consider all classes at once. As computationally more expensive solve problems, comparisons of these using large-scale problems not seriously conducted. Especially solving SVM in one step, much larger optimization problem required so up now experiments are limited small data sets. In this paper give decomposition implementations two such ""all-together"" methods. We then compare their performance with three based on classifications: ""one-against-all,"" ""one-against-one,"" and directed acyclic graph (DAGSVM).

A computational method for partitioning a charge density grid into Bader volumes is presented which efficient, robust, and scales linearly with the number of points. The algorithm follows steepest ascent paths along gradient from point to until maximum reached. In this paper, we describe how accurate off-lattice can be represented respect This improvement maintains efficient linear scaling an earlier version algorithm, eliminates tendency surfaces aligned directions. As assigns points maxima, subsequent are terminated when they reach previously assigned It grid-based approach gives its efficiency, allows analysis large grids generated plane-wave-based functional theory calculations.

Large datasets are increasingly common and often difficult to interpret. Principal component analysis (PCA) is a technique for reducing the dimensionality of such datasets, increasing interpretability but at same time minimizing information loss. It does so by creating new uncorrelated variables that successively maximize variance. Finding variables, principal components, reduces solving an eigenvalue/eigenvector problem, defined dataset hand, not priori , hence making PCA adaptive data technique. in another sense too, since variants have been developed tailored various different types structures. This article will begin introducing basic ideas PCA, discussing what it can cannot do. then describe some their application.

We investigate effectiveness many different choices all three phases: coarsening, coarsest refinement.

Over the last two decades, stochastic resonance has continuously attracted considerable attention. The term is given to a phenomenon that manifest in nonlinear systems whereby generally feeble input information (such as weak signal) can be amplified and optimized by assistance of noise. effect requires three basic ingredients: (i) an energetic activation barrier or, more generally, form threshold; (ii) coherent periodic signal); (iii) source noise inherent system, or adds input. Given these features, response system undergoes resonance-like behavior function level; hence name resonance. underlying mechanism fairly simple robust. As consequence, been observed large variety systems, including bistable ring lasers, semiconductor devices, chemical reactions, mechanoreceptor cells tail fan crayfish.

Recently the Conjugate Gradients-Squared (CG-S) method has been proposed as an attractive variant of Bi-Conjugate Gradients (Bi-CG) method. However, it observed that CG-S may lead to a rather irregular convergence behaviour, so in some cases rounding errors can even result severe cancellation effects solution. In this paper, another Bi-CG is which does not seem suffer from these negative effects. Numerical experiments indicate also new variant, named Bi-CGSTAB, often much more efficient than CG-S.

Unsupervised learning with generative adversarial networks (GANs) has proven hugely successful. Regular GANs hypothesize the discriminator as a classifier sigmoid cross entropy loss function. However, we found that this function may lead to vanishing gradients problem during process. To overcome such problem, propose in paper Least Squares Generative Adversarial Networks (LSGANs) which adopt least squares for discriminator. We show minimizing objective of LSGAN yields Pearson X2 divergence. There are two benefits LSGANs over regular GANs. First, able generate higher quality images than Second, perform more stable evaluate on LSUN and CIFAR-10 datasets experimental results generated by better ones also conduct comparison experiments between illustrate stability LSGANs.

Standard statistical practice ignores model uncertainty. Data analysts typically select a from some class of models and then proceed as if the selected had generated data. This approach uncertainty in selection, leading to over-confident inferences decisions that are more risky than one thinks they are. Bayesian averaging (BMA)provides coherent mechanism for accounting this Several methods implementing BMA have recently emerged. We discuss these present number examples.In examples, provides improved out-of-sample predictive performance. also provide catalogue currently available software.

An approach to variable metric algorithms has been investigated in which the linear search sub-problem no longer becomes necessary. The property of quadratic termination replaced by one monotonic convergence eigenvalues approximating matrix inverse hessian. A convex class updating formulae possess this established, and a strategy indicated for choosing member so as keep approximation away from both singularity unboundedness. FORTRAN program tested extensively with encouraging results.

Several reasons have contributed to the prolonged neglect into which study of statistics, in its theoretical aspects, has fallen. In spite immense amount fruitful labour been expended practical applications, basic principles this organ science are still a state obscurity, and it cannot be denied that, during recent rapid development methods, fundamental problems ignored paradoxes left unresolved. This anomalous statistical is strikingly exemplified by paper entitled ""The Fundamental Problem Practical Statistics,"" one most eminent modern statisticians presents what purports general proof BAYES' postulate, which, opinion second statistician equal eminence, ""seems rest upon very peculiar -- not say hardly supposable relation.""

We study two families of error-correcting codes defined in terms very sparse matrices. ""MN"" (MacKay-Neal (1995)) are recently invented, and ""Gallager codes"" were first investigated 1962, but appear to have been largely forgotten, spite their excellent properties. The decoding both can be tackled with a practical sum-product algorithm. prove that these ""very good"", sequences exist which, when optimally decoded, achieve information rates up the Shannon limit. This result holds not only for binary-symmetric channel also any symmetric stationary ergodic noise. give experimental results channels Gaussian demonstrating performance substantially better than standard convolutional concatenated achieved; indeed, Gallager is almost as close limit turbo codes.
