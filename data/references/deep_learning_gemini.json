      "description": "This period laid the theoretical and conceptual groundwork for neural networks. Warren McCulloch and Walter Pitts introduced the first mathematical model of an artificial neuron, demonstrating how simple logical operations could be performed. Frank Rosenblatt's Perceptron was the first practical implementation, showcasing learning capabilities and sparking initial excitement. However, Marvin Minsky and Seymour Papert's critical analysis of its limitations, particularly its inability to solve non-linearly separable problems like XOR, led to a significant slowdown in neural network research, contributing to the first 'AI Winter'.",

This decline was largely precipitated by a highly influential critique that exposed the fundamental limitations of the then-dominant single-layer perceptron models. The perceived inability of these networks to solve complex problems, coupled with the computational constraints of the era, led to a substantial shift in academic focus towards symbolic AI approaches.",
