      "description": "This era laid the fundamental groundwork for computer vision, moving from basic digital image processing to early attempts at understanding and interpreting visual information. Research focused on simulating human visual perception, symbolic AI approaches for scene understanding, and initial efforts to reconstruct 3D information from 2D images. Key contributions include the conceptualization of neural networks, basic image analysis techniques, and the 'Blocks World' problem, which highlighted the complexities of machine perception.",

      "description": "Building on early foundations, this period saw a paradigm shift towards more structured and rigorous approaches. The emphasis was on explicit 3D models, geometric reasoning, and robust low-level feature extraction. David Marr's computational theory of vision, advocating for a hierarchical approach from primal sketch to 3D models, was highly influential. Developments included foundational algorithms for edge detection, optical flow, and initial attempts at 3D reconstruction and object recognition based on geometric primitives.",
