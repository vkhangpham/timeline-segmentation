      "description": "This period marks the birth of modern applied mathematics, driven by the need to understand natural phenomena, particularly celestial mechanics. The paradigm shift was the systematic application of mathematical analysis, specifically calculus, to solve physical problems. Key figures like Isaac Newton and Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz independently developed calculus, providing powerful tools to describe motion and change. This laid the foundation for mathematical modeling of the physical world.",

      "description": "The 19th century witnessed a significant expansion of applied mathematics beyond classical mechanics, with a focus on analytical methods for complex physical systems. The paradigm shift was the development of sophisticated mathematical tools like Fourier series and vector calculus, enabling the rigorous formulation and solution of problems in continuum mechanics (fluid dynamics, elasticity) and electromagnetism. This period solidified the role of partial differential equations as a central tool.",
