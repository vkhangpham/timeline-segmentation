      "description": "This era encompasses the foundational development of mathematical concepts, with applications in astronomy, engineering, and physics by ancient and early modern civilizations. Key progress includes the early use of geometry and arithmetic in ancient Mesopotamia and Egypt, as well as the birth of calculus by Newton and Leibniz. Mathematical methods evolved in direct response to practical, real-world problems, particularly in navigation, mechanics, and astronomy.",
