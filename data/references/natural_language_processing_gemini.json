This approach was characterized by a deep understanding of linguistic theory but struggled with the inherent ambiguity, variability, and scalability of natural language.",

Advances in computational power and the availability of large text corpora (like the Penn Treebank) enabled the development of probabilistic models that learned patterns directly from data. This approach offered greater robustness to ambiguity and better scalability.",

Key developments included word embeddings, which allowed words to be represented as dense vectors capturing semantic relationships, and recurrent neural networks (RNNs), particularly LSTMs, which were effective at modeling sequential data and long-range dependencies. This significantly reduced the need for manual feature engineering.",
